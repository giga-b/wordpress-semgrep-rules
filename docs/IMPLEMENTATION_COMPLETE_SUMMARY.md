## âœ… Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All quality benchmarks and automated quality control systems have been successfully implemented and are operational.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Quality Control Infrastructure âœ…
- **`.rule-quality.yml`** - Centralized quality targets configuration

- **`tests/benchmark-testing.py`** - Comprehensive benchmark testing framework
- **`tests/fix-rule-metadata-simple.py`** - Automated rule metadata fixing

### 2. CI/CD Integration âœ…
- **`.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow for automated quality enforcement
- Automated validation on every push and pull request
- Quality gates prevent merging of non-compliant rules

### 3. Documentation âœ…
- **`docs/QUALITY_BENCHMARKS.md`** - Comprehensive quality benchmarks documentation
- **`tests/rule-completion-checklist.md`** - Rule development checklist
- **`TASK_MANAGEMENT.md`** - Updated with quality benchmarks integration

### 4. Rule Metadata Standardization âœ…
- **All 24 rule files** now have complete metadata:
  - `confidence`: high/medium/low
  - `cwe`: Appropriate CWE identifiers
  - `category`: security/quality
  - `tags`: Relevant security tags
  - `vuln_class`: xss/sqli/csrf/authz/file_upload/deserialization/secrets_storage/rest_ajax/other

## ðŸ“Š Quality Targets Enforced

### Global Targets (All Rules)
- **Precision**: â‰¥95% (true-positive percentage)
- **False Positive Rate**: â‰¤5%
- **Recall (Detection Rate)**: â‰¥95%
- **False Negative Rate**: â‰¤5%
- **Test Coverage**: 100% (at least one positive and one negative test)
- **Baseline Stability**: â‰¥99% (no regressions across versions)
- **Autofix Safety Rate**: â‰¥95% (only when autofix exists)
- **Rule Confidence**: high before promotion out of experimental

### Vulnerability Class-Specific Targets
| Vulnerability Class | Precision Target | Recall Target | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) | â‰¥95% | â‰¥90% | Context-aware detection |
| SQL Injection | â‰¥95% | â‰¥95% | wpdb misuse, raw queries |
| CSRF / Nonce | â‰¥95% | â‰¥95% | Full nonce lifecycle detection |
| Authorization (AuthZ) | â‰¥92% | â‰¥90% | current_user_can checks |
| File Upload / Path Traversal | â‰¥95% | â‰¥90% | move_uploaded_file, validation |
| Deserialization / Dynamic Exec | â‰¥95% | â‰¥95% | unserialize, eval, create_function |
| Secrets in Options/Meta | â‰¥95% | â‰¥95% | add_option/update_option on sensitive keys |
| REST/AJAX Endpoint Hardening | â‰¥95% | â‰¥95% | wp_ajax_*, register_rest_route handlers |

## ðŸ”§ Automated Quality Gates

### What Gets Checked Automatically
1. **Rule Metadata Validation** - All required fields present and valid
2. **Test Coverage** - Minimum positive and negative tests
3. **Performance Benchmarks** - Scan time and memory usage
4. **Corpus Validation** - Rules tested against real-world code
5. **Security Review** - Automated security analysis
6. **Documentation Completeness** - Required documentation present

### Quality Gate Results
- **âœ… All 24 rules pass metadata validation** (100% success rate)
