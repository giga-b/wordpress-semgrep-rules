## üéØ Severity Levels

### ERROR
Critical security vulnerabilities that must be fixed immediately. These represent actual security risks that could lead to exploitation.

### WARNING
Security concerns that should be addressed. These may not be immediately exploitable but represent potential security issues.

### INFO
Best practice recommendations. These help improve code quality and security posture but are not security vulnerabilities.

## üîó CWE Classifications

### CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Rules that detect when input data is not properly validated before use.

### CWE-22: Path Traversal
Rules that detect unsafe file path handling that could lead to directory traversal attacks.

### CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Rules that detect when user input is output without proper escaping, potentially allowing XSS attacks.

### CWE-89: SQL Injection
Rules that detect when user input is used in database queries without proper sanitization or prepared statements.

### CWE-98: PHP Remote File Inclusion
Rules that detect when user input is used in include/require statements without validation.

### CWE-285: Improper Authorization
Rules that detect when operations are performed without proper user capability checks.

### CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Rules that detect when nonce verification is missing or improperly implemented.

### CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Rules that detect when file uploads are not properly validated.

### CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site
Rules that detect when URLs are used without proper validation, potentially leading to open redirects.

```

## ü§ù Contributing New Rules

When adding new rules:

1. **Choose appropriate category**: nonce-verification, capability-checks, or sanitization-functions
2. **Set appropriate severity**: ERROR for vulnerabilities, WARNING for concerns, INFO for recommendations
3. **Assign CWE classification**: Use the most specific CWE that applies
4. **Write clear description**: Explain what the rule detects and why it's important
5. **Add test cases**: Include both vulnerable and safe examples
6. **Update this reference**: Add the new rule to the appropriate table
