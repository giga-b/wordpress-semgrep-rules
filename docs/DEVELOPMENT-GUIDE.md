## Using the PRD

### What is the PRD?

The **Product Requirements Document** (`docs/PRD-WordPress-Semgrep-Rules-Development.md`) is a comprehensive specification that outlines:

- **Project Vision**: Goals and objectives
- **Target Users**: Who will use the solution
- **Core Requirements**: Detailed feature specifications
- **Technical Requirements**: Implementation details
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure progress
- **Development Phases**: Organized timeline
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential challenges and mitigations

### How to Use the PRD

1. **Read the Executive Summary** - Understand the high-level goals
2. **Review Core Requirements** - Understand what needs to be built
3. **Check Technical Requirements** - Understand implementation details
4. **Review Development Phases** - Understand the timeline
5. **Reference Success Metrics** - Understand how to measure progress

## Using the Task List

### Generated Tasks

The `tasks.json` file contains 33 structured tasks organized by:

- **Phases**: 4 development phases (Foundation, Enhancement, Integration, Optimization)
- **Categories**: 11 task categories (rules, testing, documentation, etc.)
- **Priorities**: High, medium, low priority levels
- **Dependencies**: Logical task dependencies
- **Estimates**: Time estimates in hours

### Task Structure

Each task includes:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Task Title",
  "description": "Detailed task description",
  "phase": "Phase 1",
  "priority": "high",
  "dependencies": [2, 3],
  "estimated_hours": 8,
  "category": "rules",
  "status": "pending",
  "created": "2025-01-09T..."
}
```

### Task Categories

1. **rules** - Security rule development
2. **testing** - Test case creation and infrastructure
3. **documentation** - Documentation and guides
4. **configuration** - Configuration file management
5. **integration** - CI/CD and IDE integration
6. **tooling** - Development tools and scripts
7. **performance** - Performance optimization
8. **taint-analysis** - Advanced security analysis
9. **community** - Community features and governance
10. **features** - Advanced functionality
11. **security** - Security audits and reviews

## Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase

1. **Review the PRD** - Understand the complete project scope
2. **Examine the task list** - Review all 33 tasks
3. **Prioritize tasks** - Focus on Phase 1 tasks first
4. **Set up development environment** - Use the existing project structure

### 2. Development Phase

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Foundation tasks
2. **Follow task dependencies** - Complete prerequisite tasks first
3. **Update task status** - Mark tasks as in-progress, done, etc.
4. **Track progress** - Monitor estimated vs actual hours

### 3. Testing Phase

1. **Create test cases** - For each rule developed
2. **Run automated tests** - Use the testing infrastructure
3. **Validate results** - Ensure rules work correctly
4. **Update documentation** - Keep docs in sync with code

### 4. Integration Phase

1. **Implement CI/CD** - GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks
2. **Add IDE integration** - VS Code, Cursor support
3. **Create tooling** - Enhanced runner scripts
4. **Build community features** - Contribution guidelines

## Task Management

### Using Task Master

If you're using Task Master for project management:

1. **Import tasks** - Use the `tasks.json` file
2. **Organize by phase** - Create separate contexts for each phase
3. **Track dependencies** - Ensure proper task ordering
4. **Update progress** - Mark tasks as complete

### Manual Task Management

1. **Create a spreadsheet** - Track task progress
2. **Use project management tools** - Trello, Asana, etc.
3. **Regular reviews** - Weekly progress reviews
4. **Update estimates** - Refine time estimates as you work

## Development Best Practices

### 1. Rule Development

- **Follow the rule structure** - Use the standard YAML format
- **Include test cases** - Create both vulnerable and safe examples
- **Document thoroughly** - Clear messages and remediation guidance
- **Test extensively** - Validate against real WordPress code

### 2. Testing

- **Create comprehensive tests** - Cover all rule scenarios
- **Maintain test suite** - Keep tests up to date
- **Automate testing** - Use CI/CD for regression testing
- **Track false positives** - Monitor and reduce false positives

### 3. Documentation

- **Keep docs current** - Update as you develop
- **Include examples** - Real-world usage examples
- **Provide troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- **Write for users** - Clear, actionable guidance

### 4. Integration

- **Start simple** - Basic integration first
- **Test thoroughly** - Validate in real environments
- **Document setup** - Clear installation instructions
- **Provide support** - Help users get started

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics throughout development:

### 1. Security Coverage
- **Target**: 95% coverage of known WordPress vulnerabilities
- **Measurement**: Automated testing against vulnerability database

### 2. False Positive Rate
- **Target**: < 5% false positive rate
- **Measurement**: Manual review of findings on WordPress core

### 3. Performance
- **Target**: < 30 seconds scan time for typical plugin
- **Measurement**: Automated performance testing

### 4. Adoption
- **Target**: 100+ active users within 6 months
- **Measurement**: Usage analytics and community feedback

## Getting Started

### 1. Immediate Next Steps

1. **Review Phase 1 tasks** - Focus on foundation work
2. **Set up development environment** - Use existing project structure
3. **Start with rule development** - Begin with nonce verification rules
4. **Create test cases** - Develop comprehensive test suite

### 2. First Week Goals

- Complete project structure setup
- Develop 2-3 core security rules
- Create basic test cases
- Set up basic configuration

### 3. First Month Goals

- Complete Phase 1 foundation tasks
- Have working rule scanning
- Basic test coverage
- Clear documentation
