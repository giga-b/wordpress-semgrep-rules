3. **Future Integration**: The theme can be safely added to the corpus using the sanitization process

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. CI/CD Integration: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Test Requirements: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Quality gates fail because rules lack embedded test cases
- **Impact**: Quality validation cannot proceed
- **Solution**: ✅ Implemented comprehensive testing strategy with 6 test categories and improved quality gates script. All 10 CI scripts working properly.

### 3. Advanced Testing: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Advanced testing features have encoding and timeout issues
- **Impact**: No performance benchmarking or regression testing
- **Solution**: ✅ Fixed timeout issues (reduced from 60s to 30s), added error handling, and created comprehensive CI script tester.
